m - Code Analysis and Architecture Tool

COMMANDS:
  find <query> [filter]             Semantic code search with context patterns
  coupling [threshold]              Analyze coupling with specific problem locations
  refs <symbol> [depth]             Comprehensive reference analysis for symbols
  setup, init                       Initialize project configuration
  help                              Show this help

EXAMPLES:

  🔍 Code Discovery:
    m find "error handling"               # Find error handling patterns
    m find "database connection"          # Locate database code
    m find "authentication" auth          # Find auth code, filter by 'auth'

  📊 Architecture Analysis:
    m coupling 5                          # Files with 5+ dependencies
    m coupling 10                         # High coupling analysis with suggestions

  🔍 Reference Analysis:
    m refs UserManager                    # Complete analysis: dependencies, reverse-deps, impact
    m refs parse_file 3                   # 3-level transitive analysis with blast radius

  ⚙️ Project Setup:
    m setup                               # Initialize ast-grep rules and configuration

REFS ANALYSIS INCLUDES:
  📍 Symbol definition location
  📦 Dependencies (what the symbol uses)
  ⬅️ Reverse dependencies (what uses the symbol)
  ⛓️ Transitive impact analysis with configurable depth
  🛠️ Refactor impact summary with usage hotspots
  🚨 Risk-based color coding for all relationships

FEATURES:
  - Interactive fzf filtering and selection
  - File:line references for easy navigation
  - Context-aware search with semantic expansion
  - Risk-based color coding for relationships
  - Comprehensive dependency and reverse-dependency analysis
  - Transitive impact analysis for blast radius assessment
