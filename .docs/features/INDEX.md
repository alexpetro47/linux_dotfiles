## Feature Overview

### Theming
Dark/light toggle with `Mod+Shift+t`. Updates 6+ applications simultaneously via tinty's base16 color scheme management.

### Backup
Interactive backup menu with `backup` command. Supports git-aware repo sync, encrypted Bitwarden exports, and Simplenote sync. All backups are versioned with 3 retained copies.

### Voice Dictation
`Mod+v` starts recording, `Mod+v` again stops and transcribes. Output appears in the terminal where recording started. Background transcription keeps the system responsive.

### Toggles
Quick keyboard toggles for common needs:
- **Focus mode**: Suppress notifications
- **Lid suspend**: Keep laptop awake when closed
- **Screen recording**: FFmpeg-based capture
- **Polybar**: Hide/show status bar

### Workspace Management
Vim-style workspace switching (`Ctrl+j/k/l/;`) plus tmux-sessionizer for project-based terminal sessions.

### Speed Reading
RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) tools for consuming text faster. Multiple interfaces: popup, TUI, keyboard-controlled.
